REACTJS - NOTES - Section 1

1. Welcome to the course!
* Nothing

2. What is ReactJS?
* React is a JS library used to create UI, its the V in MVC.
* JS in the browser is able to manipulate HTML DOM, which allows users to see the change without sending a http request to the server for a new html page.

3. Why React instead of “Just JavaScript”?
* We use React instead of JS, because JS has an imperative approach(when you say how to get what you want), we have long code for one component, we have
to repeat that code again for more component but react has reactive(you register a callback and a framework is responsible for calling your callback correctly) approach and components can be reused.
* React has declarative(when you say what you want) , component focused approach.

4. Building Single-Page Applications (SPA) with React
* React can be used to control parts and even the entire page content.
* Not only that we can change routes, which gives the illusion that we’re switching pages, as react creates SPA with multiple routes.

5. Exploring ReactJS’s alternatives - (Angular/Vue)
* React - lean and focused, component based UI library. Certain Features (e.g. Routing) are added via community packages.
* Angular - Complete component based UI framework, packed with features. Uses Typescript, can be an overkill for smaller projects.
* Vue - Complete component based UI framework, includes most features. A bit less popular than React and Angular.

* Go through lecture 1 step by step, do JS refresher, make notes, complete coding lessons, understand and revise them, at the end do the react summary mini
course to get an overview.

9. Getting the most out of this course.
* Watch the videos (Choose your pace)
